					<h2>About this edition</h2>
					<p>
						A weekly blog updated as a travel memoir. documents a teaching position in a newly-opened elementary school in Mongolia. However, it was not all work! Throughout our leisure time there were many spontaneous events and outings to enjoy with colleagues and acquaintances from Canada, the USA, Australia, and Mongolia. An October expedition to the countryside, provided an opportunity to meet a nomadic family and to appreciate their generous hospitality as they were in the process of moving to a more sheltered winter location. The school administration arranged entertaining staff-bonding excursions to numerous locations of interest. An invitation to be part of a Tsagan Sar (White Moon) observance in a private home was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. While in Mongolia, opportunities were also taken for travel farther afield to Thailand, China, and Korea.

					                Needless to say, it was quite a year!

					<h3>Pam Kovacek</h3>
					<p>
						Nine years post retirement, this elementary school teacher was restless and looking for an interesting adventure. She found it in the form of a year-long teaching contract in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of the independent country of Outer Mongolia. Husband Ivan, took a leave of absence from work in early October until mid-March. Sharing our extraordinary experiences made this time together doubly meaningful and unforgettable.
